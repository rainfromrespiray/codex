# Project README ‚Äì Checkout Speed Optimization

**Read this file before making any code changes. Re-read before every update.  
If any part of this file is unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.**

---

## üéØ GENERAL EXPECTATION

The goal is to produce **bulletproof, robust code** that reorganizes the loading order from the moment a user clicks ‚ÄúClaim now‚Äù on the landing page to when the checkout page (`/checkouts/nf`) is visually loaded above the fold.

**Key focus:**
- Reduce or eliminate all possible render-blocking assets and any assets that delay either:
  - The redirect to the checkout page, or
  - The loading of above-the-fold items on the checkout page (including the mini cart and upsells).

When editing `snippet1.php`:
- Ensure all required assets are loaded correctly, in the optimal order.
- It is your responsibility to deeply research and verify all dependencies and asset requirements, so that your changes do not break any functionality or UI.
- This is why you must carefully read and understand all referenced files (see list below) before each change. This includes reviewing all logic, scripts, and asset calls related to the checkout flow and cart.

---

## üîí CRITICAL RULES

- **No Visible Layout Changes:**  
  Any code update must not result in visible layout or UI/UX changes on the checkout page at [`respiray.com/checkouts/nf`](https://respiray.com/checkouts/nf).

- **Mini Cart Accuracy:**  
  The FunnelKit mini cart on the checkout page must always show the correct items (selected color, quantity, price) based on the customer‚Äôs selection at [`respiray.com/nf-test/`](https://respiray.com/nf-test/).
  - This includes any offer or upsell items added to the cart.

---

## üåê WEBSITE LOGIC OVERVIEW

**Landing Page:** [`respiray.com/nf-test/`](https://respiray.com/nf-test/)
- Features a buy box with three offers:
  - **Offer 1:** 1 product, 2 color options (black, white)
  - **Offer 2:** 2 products, 2 color options (black, white)
  - **Offer 3:** 3 products, 2 color options (black, white)
- Each offer has its own ‚ÄúClaim now‚Äù button  
  Code for each button: `claim now1.html`, `claim now2.html`, `claim now3.html`

**Current Focus:**  
Optimize Offer 1 flow first. Once Offer 1 is working correctly and fast, extend to Offers 2 and 3.

**Redirection:**  
When clicking "Claim now," redirect the user directly to `/checkouts/nf/`‚Äî**never open the FunnelKit side cart or show a cart drawer on the landing page**.

- Global (default) WooCommerce checkout must NOT be used.

**Checkout Page:**  
Custom checkout source is provided as `checkout_source.html`.

**JS Logic:**
- The file `Offer1.js` handles client-side cart population (color, quantity) via AJAX to the custom `add_bundle_combo` endpoint, ensuring correct server/session state before redirecting.
- You can improve this file if you see room for improvement; if not, keep it as is.
- There is JavaScript and AJAX involved in the cart handoff between `/nf-test` and `/checkouts/nf`.

**Upsells:**  
FunnelKit checkout upsells also affect the mini cart and are the last items to appear above the fold on the checkout page.
- **Performance optimizations must not break upsell logic.**

---

## üöÄ PERFORMANCE GOAL

- **Current:** From "Claim now" click (Offer 1) to above-the-fold load on `/checkouts/nf` is ~10 seconds.
- **Target:** **3‚Äì4 seconds max** to above-the-fold visible content on `/checkouts/nf`‚Äîincluding mini cart and upsells.

---

## üîß OPTIMIZATION SCOPE & FILES

**Main file to optimize:**
- `snippet1.php` (this is used via a WordPress snippets plugin; do not add a `<?php` tag)

**Other files for reference and context:**
- `claim now1.html` / `claim now2.html` / `claim now3.html` ‚Äì buy button markup and triggers
- `Offer1.js` ‚Äì cart logic for Offer 1 (including AJAX/cart handoff)
- `checkout_source.html` ‚Äì snapshot of `/checkouts/nf` page
- `functions.php` ‚Äì for any hooks or custom logic relevant to cart/session/checkout
- Latest HAR file (e.g. `respiray.com_nf-test5`) ‚Äì for performance review

You may suggest improvements in other files if you find opportunities.  
All testing and optimizations must be performed on the live site.

If you wish to recommend WordPress plugins for diagnostics or performance, mention them and request installation.

---

## üõë CACHING & PLUGINS

- The site uses WP Rocket, Cloudflare CDN, and WPX XDN.
- The checkout at `/checkouts/nf` is a FunnelKit-based custom page built with Elementor.

**Important:**
- Caching the checkout page is **not recommended** and may break cart/upsell logic.
- Any optimizations must **not rely on caching** the checkout page.

---

## üßæ TESTING, HAR FILES, & ANALYSIS

- Testing must be done live; there is no staging environment.
- Each optimization attempt is evaluated using a HAR file (e.g. `respiray.com_nf-test5`):
  - HAR is started on "Claim now" (Offer 1) click, ends once all above-the-fold content (including upsells/mini cart) is visible on `/checkouts/nf`.
  - Use the highest numbered HAR file for the latest results.
  - Request count may vary due to manual HAR ending‚Äîuse HAR for comparative analysis.
- Analyze all relevant files and the latest HAR before making any changes.

---

## üìä HAR & PDF FILES FOR PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

- For each optimization/test attempt, you will find a HAR file (e.g. `respiray.com_nf-test5.har`) representing a full network recording from clicking "Claim now" (Offer 1) to the checkout page (`/checkouts/nf`) rendering above the fold.
- For each HAR file, there may also be a PDF version with the same name (e.g. `respiray.com_nf-test5.pdf`).
  - **Purpose:** The PDF is provided in case the HAR file is too large to open/analyze.
- **Use the HAR file referenced in your task instructions or ticket. If none is provided, abort your task and ask which HAR file should be analyzed before continuing.**
- **Limitation:** The PDF may not include all network/request details present in the HAR. Always analyze the `.har` file first whenever possible.
- **Special Note:**
  - `respiray.com_nf-test0.har` (and PDF version) represents a baseline test where `snippet1.php` is disabled.  
    This version serves as a control for comparing the impact of any optimizations.

---

## üìã WORKFLOW (FOR EVERY ATTEMPT)

1. Re-read this README in full.
2. Review and understand all listed files, especially the latest HAR file and `snippet1.php`.
3. Implement optimization in `snippet1.php` (unless another file is explicitly targeted).
4. Never break the mini cart or cause visual/layout changes.
5. Test, document, and submit changes with clear reasoning and what was tried/changed in the code and/or a change log.
6. Await new HAR upload and iterate as needed.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

- If an approach (e.g., preloading checkout with a fetch) improves speed but breaks mini cart/upsell logic or layout, it must not be used.
- Any change that improves speed but breaks cart logic is unacceptable.
- If in doubt, ask for clarification before proceeding.

## üí° CLARIFICATIONS

- **Mini Cart and Upsell Logic:**  
  AJAX and JavaScript (FunnelKit/Offer1.js) are involved. Keep all logic working.

- **Checkout Caching:**  
  Never cache `/checkouts/nf`‚Äîdoing so breaks dynamic cart/upsell logic.

For any uncertainty about requirements, file purpose, or optimization safety, seek clarification before proceeding.  
**Adherence to this README is mandatory.**
